Source Code for Hive:

Step 1:
Create a table.
hive> CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tweet (tweet_id string, writer string, post_date date, body string, comment_num int, retweet_num int, like_num int)
    > ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
    > FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
    > LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';

Step 2:
Load data into the table.
hive> LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/home/hadoop/IST3134/Tweet.csv' INTO TABLE tweet;

step 3:
Create a table for the wordcount.
hive> Create table wordcount as SELECT word, COUNT(*) FROM tweet LATERAL VIEW explode(split(body, ‘ ‘)) lTable as word GROUP BY word;

Step 4:
To view the results of the wordcount.
hive> Select * from wordcount;

Limit the results displayed. 
hive> Select * from wordcount limit 10;
